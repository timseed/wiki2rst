Wiki format to rst Format 

I wanted a quick way to convert some Wiki format files into rst format files. I did not want to grief of dealing with html - so I have quickly rolled my own mini class.

It does not handle much at the moment - but as my Wiki format files are quite basic this covers 99% of them.


#Useage
./wiki2rst.py <filename>  > Outputfile

At the moment there is no command line help.
